### 1.0.1

### 1.0.0

**You'll lose all of your previous revisions.** (Hopefully, for the last time.)

- **Change** modal's layout.
  + New layout may not work for some browsers. Click [here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) to see supported ones (including IE10+).
- **Change** rollback behaviour.
  + Now they'll be treated as new edits and will not delete other revisions.
- **Drop** tabular view because it wasn't fit well into community platforms.
- **Drop** renderer selector from the extension's settings.
  + Now everyone can use any renderer they wish.
- **Drop** `PostWasRollbacked` event because we're treating them as formal edits now.
- **Add** original post into revision list.
- **Add** seperate permissions for rollbacking.
- **Add** feature for keeping user's renderer preference.
- **Add** some informations about comparisons to make things more clear.
- **Add** informative tooltips to make things even more clear.
- **Add** preview mode for all revisions.
  + You need to update `s9e/text-formatter` to v2.3.7 for syntax highlighting in previews. (**skip this step** if you didn't update `flarum/core` to beta 12 yet)
  ```
  composer update s9e/text-formatter:2.3.7
  ```
  + It worked well with Flarum's extensions so far but I expect some issues from 3rd parties. Report them and I'll see what I can do. Keep in mind that you always can disable text formatting from extension's settings modal if something breaks your Diff modal but it'll look like a mess for sure.
- **Add** multiple archive rows feature.
  + If you hit the `MEDIUMBLOB`'s limit for an archive, it'll automatically create a new archive row for the post and store new revisions there. I don't think you'll ever face with this situation but i did my best to solve this potential issue.
- **Fix** `the-turk-diff.forum.noDiffs` translation key was missing.
- **Fix** all renderer-related issues.
- **Fix** wrong column types.
- **Add** new columns and foreign keys.
- **Make** Mobile & Dark Mode UI imporovements.
- **Tidy** backend codes and add comments so everyone can understand what I am doing.
- **Update** dependencies & README.md

There are new lines & few changes for translators.

**Notes:**

- All versions of this extension conflicts with [dem13n/nickname-changer](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/21238-nickname-changer) package. Use [fof/username-request](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20956-friendsofflarum-username-request) instead.

- If you're using [the-turk/flarum-edit-notifications extension](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22896-edit-notifications/17) extension, you should update it to v0.1.4
  ```bash
  composer update the-turk/flarum-edit-notifications:0.1.4
  ```

### 0.1.0-beta.7

**You'll lose all of your previous revisions again.**

- **Store** revisions as a whole instead of diffs-only.
- **Add** archive old revisions option.
  + I decided to use a linear equation **(y=mx+b)** where the **x** is post's revision count. If **x â‰¥ A**, first **y** revisions for the post can be stored as merged & compressed `BLOB` in a new table (which is called `post_edit_histories_archive`). Float values of **y** will be rounded to the next lowest integer value. Specify the **A**, **m** and **b** from the settings modal. It's recommended if you want to save storage volume but _not recommended if you don't want to_.
- **Add** cron job option for checking old revisions. (Thus, `fof/console` is a dependency from now on)
  + I set a weekly cron job which is working on sundays at 02:00 AM (nothing special) using `diff:archive` command**. If you want to archive old revisions, please consider enabling this option. Otherwise, it'll try to find & archive old revisions for the post as soon as `Post\Revised` event fires or wait for your `php flarum diff:archive` command.
- **Add** store main post revisions-only option.
- **Add** `the-turk/flarum-quiet-edits` support.
  + Strongly recommended if you want to save even more storage volume.
- **Add** lazy-loading to the revisions dropdown.
- **Add** rollback feature.
  + Users can rollback to certain revision if they have permission to delete revisions. There is a new event for developers called `PostWasRollbacked`
- **Add** new renderer called **Combined**
  + [Tabular view](https://i.ibb.co/df6JP6q/Combined-Tabular.png)
  + [Custom view](https://i.ibb.co/FYhSjLj/Combined-Custom.png)
- **Add** beta 12 compatibility.
- **Fix** some PHP-related warnings.
- **Fix** some CSS-related typos in renderers.
- **Fix** black borders for the dark mode.
- **Update** diff repository to 6.5.1

There are new lines & few changes for translators.

> **: Here is the only Cron entry you need to add to your (Linux) server:

> This Cron will call the Laravel command scheduler every minute. Then, Laravel evaluates your scheduled tasks and runs the tasks that are due.
